# Object Oriented Programming - Class, Property, Method, Object

!!! info "What You Need to Know"

    __You must be able to__ describe, identify and implement the following object-oriented constructs:

    * Class
    * Property
    * Method
    * Object

## What is a Class, Property, Method, and Object?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code that lets you build programs using objects ‚Äî just like how the real world works. For example, think about your phone. It has data like brand and colour, and it can do things like make calls or take pictures. In programming, we model things like that using classes and objects.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the main ideas:

- __Class__: This is like a blueprint or recipe. It describes what something is and what it can do, but it‚Äôs not the actual thing. A class defines the properties and methods an object will have.
- __Property__: This is a variable that holds information about the object, like its name, colour, or age. Properties are also called attributes.
- __Method__: This is a function inside the class that describes something the object can do. Methods often use the object‚Äôs properties to decide what happens.
- __Object__: This is a real thing created from a class. You can make as many objects as you like from the same class, each with its own data.

__By using OOP, your code becomes easier to understand, reuse, and update ‚Äî especially in bigger programs.__

!!! note

    You‚Äôll often see the word `self` used inside class methods. This just means ‚Äúthis object.‚Äù 
    
    When we write `self.name`, we‚Äôre talking about the `name` property that belongs to the current object. 
    
    It helps the object keep track of its own data, especially when there are lots of objects being used at the same time.

## Example

Here is a simple Python program that shows how to define a class, add properties and methods, and create an object from the class:

```python title="OOP Example"linenums="1"
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self._name = name        # Property
        self._breed = breed      # Property

    def speak(self):             # Method
        return f"{self._name} says woof!"

# Create an object from the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Rex", "Labrador")

# Call a method on the object
print(my_dog.speak())
```

### üîç Breakdown:

- `Dog` is the __class__
- `self._name` and `self._breed` are __properties__ of the object.
- `my_dog` is the __object__ created from the class.
- `speak()` is a __method__ that the object can use.

## Summary

- A __class__ is a plan for making something in code. It tells the computer what the object should know (properties) and what it should be able to do (methods).
- A __property__ stores information about the object. Every object from a class can have different values for its properties.
- A __method__ is an action that an object can perform ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a built-in ability.
- Using OOP helps you build programs that are neat, powerful, and more like how things work in real life.
- An __object__ is something you make from a class ‚Äî it‚Äôs like the real version of the plan.
