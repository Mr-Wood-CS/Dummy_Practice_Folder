# Class

## Explanation

!!! tip "Definition"
    Code that defines what an object will remember and the things it will be able to do.

A class is like a blueprint or a recipe.

If you wanted to build a car, you wouldn't just randomly start putting things together. 

You would use a blueprint that shows them how to make the car, what parts it will have, and how it will work.

A `class` is the blueprint (or set of instructions) that tells `Python` how to =="build"== a car in your program.

#### Properties

Properties are the characteristics or features of an object that are defined in the class. 

In Python, these are typically set in the __init__ method and accessed using the self keyword.

!!! example "Creating a Class with Properties"

    === "Code"

        ```python linenums="1"
            class Car:
                def __init__(self, make, model, year): 

                    self.make = make  
                    self.model = model 
                    self.year = year 
        ```
    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`
        
        This defines a class called `Car`.


        `line 2` - 
        
        This line defines a special method called `__init__`.
        
        The `__init__` method is called automatically when you create a new object (a car) from the Car class.
        
        It is used to set up the initial properties (like make, model, and year) for that object.
        
        `The parameters`:
        
        * `self`: Refers to the object being created. It allows the method to work with the object's properties.

        * `make`: A placeholder for the car's manufacturer (e.g., "Tesla").

        * `model`: A placeholder for the car's model (e.g., "Model 3").

        * `year`: A placeholder for the car's manufacturing year (e.g., 2024).

        `Line 5`
        
        This line creates a property called `make` for the car object and sets it to the value of the `make parameter` provided when the car is created.

        `Line 6`
        
        This line creates a property called `model` for the car object and sets it to the value of the `model parameter` provided when the car is created.

        `Line 7`
        
        This line creates a property called `year` for the car object and sets it to the value of the `year parameter` provided when the car is created.

#### Methods

Using the Car class, methods are the actions or things that the car can do. 

These are like the instructions in the class that tell the car how to behave.

Methods can be thought of as the abilities a car gets when it's created from the class blueprint.

!!! example "Adding the Methods"

    === "Code"

        ```python linenums="1"
            class Car:
                def __init__(self, make, model, year): 

                    self.make = make  
                    self.model = model 
                    self.year = year
                
                def start_engine(self):
                    print(f"The {self.year} {self.make} {self.model} engine has started.")

                def stop_engine(self):  
                    print(f"The {self.year} {self.make} {self.model} engine has stopped.")
        ```
    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`
        
        This defines a class called `Car`.


        `line 2` -

        `Line 7`
        
        This line creates a property called `year` for the car object and sets it to the value of the `year parameter` provided when the car is created.

        `Line 8`
        
        Define the `start_engine()` instance method that makes the car’s engine start.
        
        `Line 9`
        
        The instance method prints a message saying the car's engine has `started` using the car’s attributes (`make`, `model`, and `year`) to make the message specific to the car.

        `How It Works`

        When you call `start_engine()` on a car object, the self parameter refers to that specific car.

        It grabs the car’s year, make, and model and includes them in the message.

        `Line 11`
        
        Define the `start_engine()`instance method that makes the car’s engine start.
        
        `Line 12`
        
        The instance method prints a message saying the car's engine has `stopped` using the car’s attributes (`make`, `model`, and `year`) to make the message specific to the car.
