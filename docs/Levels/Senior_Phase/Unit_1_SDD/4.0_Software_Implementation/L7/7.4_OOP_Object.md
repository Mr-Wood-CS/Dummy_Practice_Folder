# Object Oriented Programming - Objects

!!! info "What You Need to Know"

    __You must be able to__ describe, identify and implement the following object-oriented constructs:

    * Objects

## What is an Object

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an **object** is something that contains **data** and **behaviours** bundled together. 

You‚Äôve already seen variables and functions, but an object combines both into one structure. Think of it like a character in a game ‚Äî it has:

- **Attributes** (facts/data) like a name, level, or health
- **Methods** (actions) like move, jump, or heal

Objects are created from **classes** (like blueprints). Each object made from a class is called an **instance**.

## Example

Below is a simple Python program that shows how to define a class and create an object. This code is suitable for SQA Advanced Higher level.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self._make = make
        self._model = model
        self._year = year

    def get_details(self):
        return f"{self._year} {self._make} {self._model}"

# Creating an object (an instance of Car)
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Yaris", 2018)

# Calling a method on the object
print(my_car.get_details())
```

### üîç Breakdown:
- `Car` is the class (blueprint).
- `my_car` is the object created from that class.
- It has attributes: `_make`, `_model`, and `_year`.
- It has a method: `get_details()` that gives a summary of the car.

## Summary

- An **object** is a combination of **data** (attributes) and **functions** (methods).
- Objects are created from **classes**.
- You access an object‚Äôs behaviour by calling its **methods**.
- OOP helps you structure your code in a way that models real-world things clearly.
