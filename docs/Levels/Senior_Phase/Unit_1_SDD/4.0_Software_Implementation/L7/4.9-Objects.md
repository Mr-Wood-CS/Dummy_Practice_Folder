# Objects

An object is a real thing (instance) created from a class.

Each object has its own set of properties and can perform the actions (methods) defined by the class.

When you create a car using the Car class, youâ€™re making a real instance of that class with specific details, like a car's make, model, and year. 

That instance is called an `object`.

```python linenums="1"

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def start_engine(self):
        print(f"The {self.year} {self.make} {self.model} engine has started.")

    def stop_engine(self):
        print(f"The {self.year} {self.make} {self.model} engine has stopped.")

# Creating objects (specific cars)
car1 = Car("Tesla", "Model 3", 2024)  # Object 1
car2 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020) # Object 2

# Using the objects
car1.start_engine()  # The 2024 Tesla Model 3 engine has started.
car2.start_engine()  # The 2020 Toyota Corolla engine has started.
