# Linear Searching

!!! info "What you need to Know"

    Describe, exemplify, and implement linear search
    
    Read and explain code that uses constructs appropriate to this level.

## Explanation

A linear search checks each element of a list one by one until the target value is found or the list ends.  
It does **not require the list to be sorted**.

The algorithm works by:
1. Starting at the first element of the list.
2. Comparing the current element with the target value.
3. If a match is found, the index (position) is returned.
4. If no match is found by the end of the list, the search returns "not found".

This makes linear search simple to implement, but slower than binary search for large datasets.

## Linear Search of Sorted Integers

=== "Python"

    ```python linenums="1"
    numbers = [5, 8, 2, 7, 3, 10]

    def linear_search(array, target):
        for index in range(len(array)):
            if array[index] == target:
                return f"{target} found at index {index}!"
        return f"{target} is not in the list."

    print(linear_search(numbers, 7))
    ```

=== "Explanation"

    `Line 1 - Create the list`
    : An array of integers is created (unsorted in this case).

    `Line 3 - Define the function`
    : The function `linear_search` takes the array and a target value.

    `Line 4 - Loop through the list`
    : Each element is checked in turn using its index.

    `Line 5 - Compare with target`
    : If the element matches the target, the index is returned.

    `Line 7 - If not found`
    : If the loop ends without a match, a message is returned.

## Linear Search of Strings

=== "Python"

    ```python linenums="1"
    names = ["Alice", "Charlie", "Emma", "Jack", "Olivia", "Sophia", "Zach"]

    def linear_search(array, target):
        for index in range(len(array)):
            if array[index] == target:
                return f"{target} found at index {index}!"
        return f"{target} is not in the list."

    print(linear_search(names, "Olivia"))
    ```

=== "Explanation"

    `Line 1 - Create the list`
    : A list of names is created.

    `Line 3 - Define the function`
    : Function takes the list of names and the target name.

    `Line 4 - Loop through`
    : Each name is checked one by one.

    `Line 5 - Compare with target`
    : If the name matches, the index is returned.

    `Line 7 - If not found`
    : Otherwise, the function returns that the name is not found.

## Linear Search 2D Arrays

=== "Python"

    ```python linenums="1"
    # Step 1: Create a 2D array
    matrix = [
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2, 5, 8],
        [3, 6, 9]
    ]

    # Step 2: Define linear search for 2D
    def linear_search_2d(array, target):
        for row in range(len(array)):
            for col in range(len(array[row])):
                if array[row][col] == target:
                    return (row, col)
        return None

    # Step 3: Test the function
    target = 6
    result = linear_search_2d(matrix, target)
    print(f"The target {target} is at position: {result}")
    ```

=== "Explanation"

    `Line 1 - Create the 2D array`
    : A 3x3 grid of numbers.

    `Line 8 - Define the function`
    : The function loops through rows and columns.

    `Line 10 - Check value`
    : If the current element matches the target, return its position.

    `Line 13 - Not found`
    : If not found after the full search, return None.

## Linear Search in Unsorted 2D Arrays

=== "Python"

    ```python linenums="1"
    unsorted_array = [
        [5, 12, 7],
        [3, 9, 1],
        [8, 6, 2]
    ]

    def linear_search_2d(array, target):
        for row in range(len(array)):
            for col in range(len(array[row])):
                if array[row][col] == target:
                    return (row, col)
        return None

    target = 9
    result = linear_search_2d(unsorted_array, target)
    print(f"The target {target} is at position: {result}")
    ```

=== "Explanation"

    `Line 1 - Create unsorted 2D array`
    : The numbers are not in order.

    `Line 7 - Define function`
    : Loops through rows and columns.

    `Line 9 - Check value`
    : If the number matches the target, return position.

    `Line 12 - Not found`
    : If search ends without match, return None.
