# 2d Arrays

## Explanation

A 2D array is like a table or grid, made up of rows and columns. Each position in a 2D array can hold a value, much like how a cell in a spreadsheet works. 

This allows us to store and work with data efficiently.

!!! info "Example "
        
    Imagine a chessboard, which has 8 rows and 8 columns. 
    
    Each square on the board can hold a piece (like a pawn or bishop), and each piece can be positioned at a specific spot determined by its row and column number.

    > Row 1, Column 1 might hold a white rook.


    > Row 2, Column 3 might hold a black knight.

    This is exactly how a 2D array works! 

    ==Each cell can be accessed using two indices: one for the row and one for the column.==

## How Does it Work?

Imagine a classroom with 12 pupils who sit in 3 rows of desks with 4 columns. 

You could create an array for each row:

``` python linenums="1"

row1 = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
row2 = ["Eve", "Frank", "Grace", "Hannah"]
row3 = ["Ian", "Jack", "Katie", "Liam"]

```
However, this is not always efficiant.

Using a 2d array would allow each classroom to store their seating plan in one array:

``` python linenums="1"

classroom1 = [
        
        ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"],
        ["Eve", "Frank", "Grace", "Hannah"],
        ["Ian", "Jack", "Katie","Liam"]
        
        ]

```

### Accessing Elements

To find a specific student's name, we use row and column indexes (counting starts at 0!):

``` python linenums="1"

print(students[1][2])  # Output: Grace

```

### Changing Values

``` python linenums="1"

students[2][3] = "Lucas"
print(students[2][3])  # Output: Lucas

```
Now, `Liam` has been replaced with `Lucas`.

### Looping Through a 2D Array

We can use loops to go through each row and column:

``` python linenums="1"

for row in students:
    for name in row:
        print(name, end=" ")  # Prints all names in a single line

```
## Appending to a 2D Array

### Adding a New Row

To add a new row to a 2D array, use `.append()`:

``` python linenums="1"

classroom1 = [

        ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"],
        ["Eve", "Frank", "Grace", "Hannah"],
        ["Ian", "Jack", "Katie","Liam"]

        ]

classroom1.append(["Paul", "Claire"," Shaun"])

```

### Adding a New (empty) Column, to Each Row

``` python linenums="1"

classroom1 = [

        ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"],
        ["Eve", "Frank", "Grace", "Hannah"],
        ["Ian", "Jack", "Katie","Liam"]

        ]

# Adding a new column (adding "Grace" and "Hannah" to each row)
for row in classroom1:
    row.append(" ")  # You can change this value for each row

print(classroom1)

```
