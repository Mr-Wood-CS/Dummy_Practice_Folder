# Insertion Sort

!!! info "What you need to Know"

	Describe, exemplify, and implement insertation sorts
	
	Read and explain code that uses constructs appropriate to this level.

## Explanantion

An insertion sort traverses an array from the second element to the last. 

Each element is compared to the elements before in turn, working backwards down the list.  Values are swapped until the element being compared is placed in order.

## Examples

??? example "Insertion Sort (1D Arrays)"

    ``` python title="Insertion Sort Algorithm for a 1D Array" linenums="1" 

    scores = [7, 2, 5, 3, 4]                                        # Initial unsorted list

    # --------- Insertation Sort ----------

    # Loop through each score starting from the second element

    for i in range(1, len(scores)):                                 # Iterate from the second element to the end
      current_score = scores[i]                                     # The score to insert
      j = i - 1                                                     # Index of the previous element

      # Shift scores greater than current_score to the right

      while j >= 0 and scores[j] > current_score:                   # While not at start and previous score is greater
        scores[j + 1] = scores[j]                                   # Move the score one position to the right
        j -= 1                                                      # Move to the previous score

      # Insert the current score into the correct position

      scores[j + 1] = current_score                                 # Place current_score in its sorted position

    # Print the sorted list of scores

    print("Sorted Scores:")                                         # Output header
    for score in scores:                                            # Loop through sorted scores
      print(score)                                                  # Print each score
