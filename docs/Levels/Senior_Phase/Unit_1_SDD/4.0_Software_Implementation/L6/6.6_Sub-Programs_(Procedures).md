# Sub-programs

## Modularity

Modularity is when a program is split up into smaller chunks called sub-programs. 

Each sub-program does a specific job. For example one sub-program may be to get user information. 

> 🔑 Each subprogram can be used in any order and can be reused multiple times. 

## Procedures and Functions

* Procedures and functions both do things with data
* They’re both subprograms or blocks of reusable code
* But the key difference lies in how they return results and how they are used in a program.

=== "Procedure & Functions Shared Components"

    ``` python linenums="1" hl_lines="1 5"

	def greet(name):

		#Some code here....

	greet("Alice")
	```
=== "Explanation"

	`Line 1`

	:	This line defines a subprogram called greet.

		* def is the Python keyword used to declare a function or procedure.
		* greet is the name of the subprogram.
		* (name) is a parameter, which means this procedure expects some data (in this case, a name) to be passed into it when it is called.

		💡 **This is where the procedure is set up, but it won’t run until it’s called.**

	`Line 5`

	:	This line calls the greet procedure and passes the value "Alice" to it as an argument.

		* The value "**Alice**" replaces the name parameter inside the procedure.
		* The code inside the procedure will now run using "**Alice**" as the input.

		💡 **This is where the procedure/function is actually used and executed.**


**Procedures**

A procedure is a set of instructions that does a specific task in a program. 

Before you can use a procedure, you have to define it — this means giving it a name and telling the computer what kind of data it will need. 

> **That data is sent into the procedure using parameters.**

Once the procedure receives the data, it performs an action using it. This could be something like displaying a message on the screen or changing a value. 

``` python title="Procedure Example" linenums="1" hl_lines="3"

def greet(name):

    print(f"Hello, {name}!") #This makes it a procedure

greet("Alice")
```

> 💡 With a procedure the result doesn’t always come back to the main program — sometimes it just creates an effect. But if the result is passed back, it can be used in another part of the program.

**Functions**

A function is a set of instructions that does something and returns a result to the main program.

Just like a procedure, before you can use a function, you have to define it (give it a name) and tell the computer what kind of data it will need. 

> **That data is sent into the function using parameters.**

``` python title="Function Example" linenums="1" hl_lines="3"

def square(x):

    return x * x  # This makes it a function

result = square(5)  # result now equals 25
```

> 💡 A function always returns a value back to the main program using the return keyword.

## 🔑 Key Differences: Procedure vs Function

| Feature               | Procedure                            | Function                             |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Returns a value?**  | ❌ No – does not return a value       | ✅ Yes – uses `return` to give a result |
| **Used in expressions?** | 🚫 No – usually called on its own     | ✅ Yes – can be used in calculations or conditions |
| **Primary purpose**   | To **perform an action or task**     | To **compute and return** a result   |
| **Example (Python)**  | `print_greeting("Sam")` → prints output | `total = add(5, 3)` → returns `8`    |
| **Think of it as...** | A **robot doing a task**             | A **calculator**                     |


## Parameters
The movement fo data between sub programs is implemented using parameters.

When a program uses a subprogram (like a function or a procedure), it often needs to send information to it. This information is called a parameter. 

> 💡Parameters can be things like variables, arrays, or lists.

There are two main types of parameters:

* __In parameters__: These are used to send data into a subprogram.
* __Out parameters__: These are used to send data out of a subprogram back to the main program.

The process of sending this data is called parameter passing. 

When you see a top-level design:

* __If you see in: next to a piece of data, it means that the data is going into the subprogram (an in parameter)__. 

* __If you see out:, it means data is coming out of the subprogram (an out parameter)__.

## Actual and Formal Parameters

The __actual parameters__ are the values being passed into the parameters

The __formal parameters__ are the values being used in the procedure/function.

``` python title="Actual and Formal Parameters" linenums="1" hl_lines="3"
# Function
def double(value):
    result = value * 2
    return result 

# Main program
original = 5                 
doubled = double(original)   

print("Original:", original)
print("Doubled:", doubled)
```
