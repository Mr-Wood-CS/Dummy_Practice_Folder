# Pre-defined Functions

!!! info "What you need to know"

	You must be able to describe and implement pre-defined functions (with parameters):

	* to create substrings
	* to convert from character to ASCII and vice versa
	* to convert floating-point numbers to integers
	* modulus

## Explanation

A pre-defined function is a section of code that has been written, checked, tested, translated and saved in a function library for later use. 

In short, a pre-defined functions mean you don't have to write lots of code to do simple things. 

??? Substrings

	You know already that a string is a collection of characters:

	| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
	|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
	| H | e | l | l | o |   | W | o | r | l | d  |

	A substring is an extract of the string, between two points. In the example above, the substring is “Hello“.

	Uses for substrings:

	* Find the first character in a word or sentence
	* Extract one character at a time, e.g. to convert them to ASCII codes
	* Search for the position of a space between two words

	We can extract (or slice) the substring with this syntax:

	```python linenums="1"
	mystring = "Hello world"
	sub1 = mystring[ marker1 : marker2 ]
	```

	__Where marker1 and marker2 are two integer numbers or variables, e.g. 0 and 4.__

	```python linenums="1"
	mystring = "Hello world"
	sub1 = mystring[0:4]
	```

	__This would return the first four characters (0 to 4): Hello.__

	Example

	This program has a string (Hello world) and uses a fixed loop to print out one character/letter at a time

	=== "Python"

		```python linenums="1"
		mystring = "Hello world"

		for counter in range(0, len(mystring)):

			a = counter
			b = counter + 1
			letter = mystring[a:b]
			print(letter)
		```

	=== "Theory"

		```pseudocode linenums="1"

		DECLARE mystring INITIALLY "Hello world"
		DECLARE letter INITIALLY ""
		DECLARE a INITIALLY 0
		DECLARE b INITIALLY 0

		FOR counter FROM 1 TO length(mystring) DO
			SET a TO counter
			SET b TO counter + 1
			SET letter TO substring(mystring, a, b - a)
			SEND letter TO DISPLAY
		ENDFOR
		```

	## Characters at the end of a string

	Substring also allows us to work backwards.

	If we want the last character of the string, we could use -1 as a shortcut. This code returns ‘__d__’:

	```python linenums="1"
	mystring = "Hello world"
	sub4 = mystring[-1]
	```
	To find the last five characters, we would start at position -5 (5 from the end), and leave the second parameter blank. 

	The variable sub5 would contain “rld”, and sub6 would contain “world”.

	```python linenums="1"
	mystring = "Hello world"
	sub5 = mystring[-3:]
	sub6 = mystring[-5:]
	```

	







??? ASCII-to-Character and Vice Versa

	Every character (every letter, digit or symbol) can be represented by a number. 

	They use a system of ASCII (7 or 8 bit) or Unicode (16 bit).

	| ASCII Number | Character |
	|:------------:|:---------:|
	|      65      |     A     |
	|      116     |     t     |
	|      37      |     %     |

	There are two functions that convert back and forth between ASCII codes and their associated characters.

	To get an ASCII number from a character:	 

	> ord() __‘ord’__ is short for __‘ordinal’__
	```python linenums="1"
	mychar = input("Enter a character")
	print(ord(mychar))
	```

	To get a character from an ASCII number:	 

	> chr()
	``` python linenums="1"
	mynumber = int(input("Enter an ascii code"))
	print(chr(mynumber))
	```

	Example

	This program asks the user to enter a letter. 

	It tells them if they have entered an upper-case letter (ASCII 65-90), lower-case letter (ASCII 97-122) or some other character.

	```python linenums="1"
	letter = input("Please enter an upper-case or lower-case letter")

	# Convert to an ASCII integer number
	letter_code = ord(letter)

	# Check if an upper-case, lower-case or something else
	if letter_code >= 65 and letter_code <= 90:
	print("Upper case letter")
	elif letter_code >= 97 and letter_code <= 122:
	print("Lower case letter")
	else:
	print("That is not a letter")
	```
	Common uses for these functions are:

	* Simple encryption programs (convert words and letters into numeric codes)
	* Looking for capital letters in input validation (e.g. a password or spellcheck)



??? "Floating Point to Integer"

	You can convert a floating-point number to an integer. It is known as ==“__truncating__”== the number and __is not the same as rounding__.

	When a number is truncated, it removes the fractional part.

	In maths, this is known as a ==floor function==. 

	__It finds the last integer lower than the number passed.__

	So, if we say:

	```python linenums="1"
	num1 = int(3.14159265)
	print(num1)
	```

	==The program will display 3.==

	However:

	```python linenums="1"
	num1 = int(3.99999999)
	print(num1)
	```
	==Will also display 3, not 4.==

	Example

	This program begins with an array of floating-point numbers and uses a running total algorithm to add up the totals. 

	However, it truncates each number before totalling. So, 3.91 becomes 3, 2.68 becomes 2, etc.

	```python linenums="1"
	# Get a list of temperatures
	temperatures = [11.21, 2.68, 3.91, 4.11]
	total = 0

	# Loop through the numbers and add them to the total
	for counter in range(0, 4):
	# Get the ‘current’ temperature and convert to integer
	temp = temperatures[counter]
	shortened = int(temp)
	# Add shortened temp to the total
	total = total + shortened
	```   
	!!! warning ASCII-to-Character and Vice Versa

		Do not confuse truncation with rounding. If you are asked to convert the number to an integer, without being told to round it, you should use this new function. If in doubt, use this one for Higher.

??? "Modulus"

	If we divide 17 ÷ 4, the answer is 4, with remainder 1. 
	
	If we divide 22 ÷ 4, the answer is 5, remainder 2.

	The modulus function returns the remainder only. 
	
	The modulus function here would return 1, and 2.

	The syntax for modulus  is different from a ==“__proper__”== function. It it is written like an operator:

	```python linenums="1"
	remainder = 5 % 2
	print(remainder)
	```

	This would divide 5 by 2, and print the remainder, 1. 

	Example

	This program asks the user to enter a number. 
	
	It identifies if the number is odd or even. 
	
	It divides it by 2, and if there is no remainder, the number must be even; if the remainder is 1, the number is odd.

	```python linenums="1"
	# Ask the user to enter a number
	num = int(input("Please enter a number"))

	# Divide by 2 to get the remainder
	remainder = num % 2
	# If remainder is 0, number is even
	if remainder == 0:
	print("This is an even number")
	else:
	print("This is an odd number")
	```
