# Scope_of_Variables

## Local & Global Variables

During National 5 you worked with variables throughout the entire scope of a program as well as accessing, using and changing their data values anywhere in the code, this is known as a Global Variable.

A __global__ variable is created in the main part of the program and can be passed/accessed by other parts of the program.

A __local__ variable however is only used within a single block of code and cannot be seen or accessed from other parts of the program.

The scope of a variable defines which part of the program can see the variable and change its value. 

__For example the scope of a local variable is the subroutine it is in.__

!!! example

	```Python
		totalAppDownloads = 2305651
	
		def downloadsForMonth():
	
		    print "Current download amount: ", totalAppDownloads,"downloads"
		
		    monthDownloads = int(raw_input("How many downloads did the App have this month?  "))
		
		    return monthDownloads
	
		def newTotalDownloads(monthDownloads):
		
		    totalAppDownloads = totalAppDownloads + monthDownloads
		
		    return
	```
