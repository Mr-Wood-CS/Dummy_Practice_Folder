Imagine you have been asked to create a program that asks for 3 test scores, adds them together, and prints out the total.

It could probably start with something like this:

``` python linenums="1"
score1 = int(input("Please enter first score"))
score2 = int(input("Please enter second score"))
score3 = int(input("Please enter third score"))
```

What happens when we need a program that asks for 20 scores? Or 100? 

We could write out every variable, but it would be a very long program, and the chance for mistakes is high. 

Instead, we need an array.

An array is simaler to a variable. 

Only this variable, can store multiple values. 

This is called an array. Where a normal variable stores data in one memory location , an array reserves a whole set of memory locations, one after the other. 

In `Python` an array is known a list:

<figure markdown="span">
    ![List Example](Images/List2.png){ width="400" }
</figure>

In the example array above, there are 9 elements. Each item makes up one element of the array. 

We start counting the elements from 0 (instead of 1). 

So element 0 in that array is 15, element 1 is 20, and element 7 is 19 and so on.

Like variables, arrays have data types (a string array, an integer array, a Boolean array, etc.)

When you see the term ==data structure==, this refers to a ==variable== or an ==array==.

## Accessing Elements in an Array

If we want to use one of the elements in the array, we can refer to it by number.

So, to get 18 from the list of scores (element 3), we would say:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]

find_score = scores[3]
```
We put the number of the element in square brackets. 

==Remember that element numbers start at zero.==

It doesn’t ,however, need to be a literal number in the square brackets. 

If we had a variable (this one is called counter), we could put that in the square brackets to get the `“counter-nth”` element:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]

counter = 4

print(scores[counter])
```

The above program would output the `4th element`, `17`

## Changing the Values in Array

In addition, we can also change the data stored in each element, including with calculations:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]

scores[0] = 17
scores[1] = 19
scores[4] = scores[2]
scores[5] = 5 * 3
scores[6] = scores[2] + 1
```

The updated list would now look like this:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [17, 19, 19, 18, 19, 15, 20, 19, 12]
```

# Appending to an Array

Python `append()` function enables us to add an element to the end of an array. 

You would use Python `append()` when you are adding to new items to the ==end of a list==


```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]

scores.append(56)
```

The updated list would now look like this:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [17, 19, 19, 18, 19, 15, 20, 19, 12, 56]
```
