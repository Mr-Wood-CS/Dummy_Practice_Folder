## The Software Development Lifecycle

The __Software Development Lifecycle__ is generally an iterative process that consists of six stages:

* Analysis - to fully understand the problem and what the program must do
* Design - to plan how the program will work before building it
* Implementation - to write the actual code
* Testing - to check that the program works correctly and meets the requirements
* Documentation - to produce materials that help users and future developers understand and use the software.
* Evaluation - to judge how successful the software is


## The Waterfall Method

A traditional method of software development is called the __Waterfall Method__.

The __Waterfall Method__ is classified as a linear development process, as the developer or development team works through each stage sequentially with little to no involvement from the client until the final product is delivered.

Although it is classified as a linear development process, in practice it is often necessary to revisit earlier stages. For example, if an issue is discovered during testing, the team may need to go back and revise the design, reimplement it, and test it again.

In the early days of software engineering, this process made sense. 

__However, it is rarely used in modern software development due to its lack of flexibility__.

In the real world, many developers use __Agile methods__.

## Agile Methods

__Agile__ is considered more flexible than traditional iterative methods. 

Instead of following a rigid sequence of stages, Agile breaks the project down into smaller, manageable units of work based on what the client needs known as __User Stories__.

Each of these __User Stories__ are included in the overal __Software Development Plan__. The __Software Development Plan__ will also idnetify the timescale for which each __User Story__ should be completed. 

Teams of developers will work in shorts __“sprints”__ to produce working prototypes which can be tested by the client.

Each sprint typically lasts __one to four weeks__ and involves a cycle of planning, design, implementation, and testing. This approach allows teams to produce working software early and update it frequently based on feedback.

A key benefit of Agile is its emphasis on collaboration and adaptability. Stakeholders, including clients and end-users, are involved throughout the development process, not just at the beginning or end. This ongoing communication helps ensure that the software continues to meet the users’ needs as they evolve.

By regularly reassessing priorities and making improvements at each step, Agile teams can respond to changes quickly—something that is much harder to do with more traditional methods like Waterfall. As a result, Agile has become one of the most widely adopted methodologies in modern software development.

## Advantages/Disadvantages

=== "Waterfall Method"

    __Advantages__

    : The Waterfall model is well suited to large-scale projects and big development teams, especially when there is a long lead time. Since the client is usually less involved once development begins, they must clearly define their requirements at the start, as this forms part of the legally binding contract.

    : This model focuses more on producing high-quality software than on rapid development. As a result, the software tends to be thoroughly tested and contains fewer bugs. Projects using the Waterfall approach are often completed on schedule and within budget.

    : Setting clear milestones at the beginning of the project helps both the development team and the client monitor progress more easily.

    __Disadvantages__

    : One of the main drawbacks of the Waterfall model is its rigid, step-by-step structure, which makes it difficult to change the plan once development has started. Since client input is usually only gathered at the beginning of the project, they are not involved throughout. This means that if the client is unsure about what they need at the start or if their requirements change during the project, the final software may not meet their expectations.

    : Another issue is that once the software reaches the testing stage, making changes can be challenging. If updates are needed at that point, it can take extra time and increase costs.

    : To reduce this problem, it can help to involve clients at key points during the project so that adjustments can be made earlier in the process.

=== "Agile Methodology"

    __Advantages__

    : Agile is ideal for smaller projects, such as developing or regularly updating apps, and works well with small development teams. The client is actively involved throughout the entire development process, and regular feedback is gathered.

    : This close collaboration helps ensure that the final product closely matches what the client wants, even if their initial requirements were unclear. Agile also offers flexibility—if the client changes their mind or wants to add new features, these changes can usually be made without too much difficulty.

    __Disadvantages__

    : The Agile methodology has several drawbacks. Initially, there's often no formal, legally binding contract, which can be problematic given the evolving nature of client requirements. Furthermore, Agile is not well-suited for extensive projects or large teams. Clients must also be ready to dedicate significant time to the project, as their continuous involvement is essential.

    : Another major disadvantage lies in the stringent sprint deadlines, which can lead to incomplete projects. In such cases, the client may face increased costs to finalize the project, or they might have to accept a deliverable with a considerably reduced scope. The frequent updates inherent in Agile can also be challenging to monitor and necessitate rigorous version control for each iteration or update.

    <td><strong>Client Interaction</strong></td>
    <td>The client is usually involved only at the <strong>analysis</strong> and <strong>evaluation</strong> stages. There is little to no client input during design, implementation, and testing phases.</td>
    <td>Agile encourages <strong>frequent client feedback</strong> throughout the project. Ongoing collaboration helps shape the product and ensures it meets client needs.</td>

  <tr>
    <td><strong>Teamwork</strong></td>
    <td>Separate teams handle different phases independently, such as design, implementation, and testing. Communication between teams can be limited, potentially causing delays if issues arise.</td>
    <td>Agile teams are <strong>cross-functional</strong> and collaborative, combining designers, developers, and testers who work together continuously with rapid communication and shared goals.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Documentation</strong></td>
    <td>Relies on a single, detailed <strong>project specification</strong> created at the start, which guides the entire project. Changes late in the project can be costly.</td>
    <td>Minimizes formal documentation, favouring lightweight, flexible documents created as needed. Focus is on working software and communication over paperwork.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Measurement of Progress</strong></td>
    <td>Progress is measured by completing each phase in order, with the final product delivered at the end for client evaluation.</td>
    <td>Progress is measured by how quickly features are delivered and demonstrated. Agile teams deliver working software regularly with frequent client feedback.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Adaptive vs Predictive</strong></td>
    <td>Iterative development is more <strong>predictive</strong>, relying on detailed upfront planning and following a set sequence of phases.</td>
    <td>Agile is highly <strong>adaptive</strong>, embracing change and continuously adjusting based on feedback and testing throughout the project.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Testing</strong></td>
    <td>Testing happens mainly after implementation in a distinct phase, often late in the process, risking discovering problems late.</td>
    <td>Testing is continuous and integrated throughout development. Each part is tested as it is built, reducing costly late fixes.</td>
