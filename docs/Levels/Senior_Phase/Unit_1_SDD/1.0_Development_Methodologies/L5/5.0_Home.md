## What is a Software Development Methodology?

To answer this, we will split the question into two parts, Software and Development Methodology.

As you already know, all computer systems are made up of hardware and software.

The term hardware is easy to understand, because you can touch it. For example, the processor, RAM, network adaptor and graphic cards etc...

==Software, however, is not so obvious………………==

Software is all the programs, instructions and data that allow the hardware to do something useful and interesting. Some of the most used include; word, excel, PowerPoint & Google (other browsers are available!)

!!! tip

	Software Development is defined as the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining computer programs and applications. There are many different  Software Development Methodologies that all follow a different path through the Development Process. 

## The Software Development Lifecycle

The __Software Development Lifecycle__ is generally an iterative process that consists of six stages:

* Analysis - to fully understand the problem and what the program must do
* Design - to plan how the program will work before building it
* Implementation - to write the actual code
* Testing - to check that the program works correctly and meets the requirements
* Documentation - to produce materials that help users and future developers understand and use the software.
* Evaluation - to judge how successful the software is


## The Waterfall Method

A traditional method of software development is called the __Waterfall Method__.

The __Waterfall Method__ is classified as a linear development process, as the developer or development team works through each stage sequentially with little to no involvement from the client until the final product is delivered.

Although it is classified as a linear development process, in practice it is often necessary to revisit earlier stages. For example, if an issue is discovered during testing, the team may need to go back and revise the design, reimplement it, and test it again.

##  The Six Stages of Development

### Analysis

> What is the purpose of the program? 

> What features will it have? (This is known as functional requirements)

> What are the inputs, process and outputs?

> What data structures and data types will be used?

### Design

> The more planning you do the quicker the creation of the final product will be

> Break a problem into chunks 

> Use diagrams to create and algorithm

> Pseudocode, Structure Diagrams and Flowcharts

### Implementation

> Create the solution to the problem

> Use previously designed Algorithms to signpost the way

### Testing

> All work needs to be checked thoroughly for errors. 

> Rigorous testing to systematically check every single operation/event.

> Rigorously test a range of scenarios to make sure the program does what it is supposed to.

### Documentation

> Collate diagrams, algorithms and testing tables.

> These documents together form the wider documentation (user guide & technical guide).

> It is important that documentation is clear.

> Documentation should also show what each person did and what has happened thus far. 

### Evaluation

> Fit for Purpose - does it do what it is supposed to do?

> Efficient use of Coding Constructs  - correct use of repetition, arrays (instead of variables) and selection statements where possible to reduce the amount of code?

> Robustness – can it cope with unexpected or incorrect input?

> Readability - it is important to write code that can be read and understood by others. This should include internal commentary, meaningful identifiers, indentation and white space.
