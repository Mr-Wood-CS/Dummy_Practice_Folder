# Technical Feasibility

Technical feasibility examines whether the proposed system can be developed and implemented using available technology, hardware, and expertise. It helps identify whether the organisation has the technical capability or needs additional resources.

    Technical feasibility assesses whether the system can be built and run using the organisation‚Äôs current or accessible technology. It includes:

    - **Required hardware and software**: Are the necessary tools available or affordable?
    - **Technical skills**: Do staff or developers have the expertise to implement and maintain the system?
    - **Integration**: Can the new system work with existing systems?
    - **Support and maintenance**: Are updates, patches, and technical support available?

    If a school wants to run a new multimedia learning platform but only has outdated computers, the system may not be technically feasible unless upgrades are made.
