# User Surveys

In addition to to the Feasability study, surveys and questionnaires help gather feedback from users, especially when many opinions are needed. This helps ensure the system meets real needs.

!!! abstract "ðŸ“‹ What is User Feasibility?"

    User feasibility ensures that the proposed solution aligns with user expectations and requirements, which is essential for the project's success. It helps determine:
    
    - **User needs**: Will the system actually solve the usersâ€™ problems?
    - **Ease of use**: Is the system user-friendly and intuitive?
    - **User acceptance**: Are users willing to adopt the system?
    - **Usability challenges**: Are there barriers that could prevent adoption?

    Here's why user feasibility is important:
    - It **identifies potential roadblocks** early, such as usability issues or resistance to change, allowing adjustments to the design or implementation plan.
    - It ensures the project **addresses real user needs**, increasing its relevance and value.
    - It improves the overall **user experience** by considering preferences and behaviours.
    - It **increases adoption rates** â€“ if users find the system easy to use and beneficial, they're more likely to embrace it.

    In short, user feasibility isn't just a nice-to-have â€“ it's essential for determining whether a project is practical, usable, and likely to succeed.

> For example, a new library system would be developed following some time spent capturing the experience of existing librarians and how they operate.

The users of a particular program are often best placed to identify problems and suggest improvements based on real experience. If the system is brand new, the target user group should still understand the domain well enough to provide useful input.

When the opinion of a number of users is required, it is often easier to create a survey or questionnaire which will capture the information that the project team require.

**Example**:  
A college developing a new library system might survey librarians to ask what features they need most.
