# Legal Feasibility

Legal feasibility is about ensuring the proposed system complies with all relevant laws and regulations. Organisations must assess any legal risks that may arise from developing, deploying, or using the system.
    
!!! abstract "⚖️ What is Legal Feasibility?"

    Legal feasibility considers whether the new system complies with relevant laws and regulations, including:

    - **Contracts and liability:** Will the system change responsibilities under existing contracts?
    - **Health and safety:** Will it meet workplace and digital safety standards?
    - **Data protection laws (e.g. GDPR):** Will it handle personal data legally and securely?
    - **International regulations:** Will it comply with laws in other countries where users or data may reside (e.g. EU, USA)?
    - **Software licensing:** Are appropriate licenses available and affordable?

!!! info "Software Licensing Considerations"

    Software licensing can be complex and must be carefully checked. The organisation must ensure that:
    
    - The right type of licence is used:
      - **Client licence (per seat)**
      - **Server licence**
      - **Network licence**
      - **Site licence**

    - The licence duration is appropriate:
      - **Annual subscription**
      - **Perpetual (one-off) purchase**

    Different vendors have different rules, so licensing terms should be verified before proceeding.
