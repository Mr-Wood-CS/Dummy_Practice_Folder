# UML Use Case Diagrams

!!! info "What You Need to Know"

    __You must be able to__ describe, identify and implement Unified Modelling Language (UML):

    * Use Case Diagrams
        * Actors
        * Use Cases
        * Relationships

## What is UML?

UML (__Unified Modelling Language__) is a way of planning how a system will work before you start building it.

One type of UML is a __Use Case Diagram__ which shows how users (called __actors__) will interact with the system, and what tasks (called __use cases__) they can do. 

__Use Case Diagrams__ are used during the __analysis stage__ of the __Software Development Process__ to help plan out what a system should do.

> In short, it helps you understand what the system needs to do and who will use it.

## Key terms:

- __System Boundaries__: 

  A system boundary is a box that surrounds all the use cases in a diagram. It shows what is included in the system and separates it from everything outside of it. Anything inside the boundary is part of the system being designed, while anything outside (like users or other systems) interacts with it from the outside. This helps clearly define the scope of the system.

- __Actors__: These are the people or systems that interact with what you're designing. For example, a “Customer” or “Admin.” For Advanced Higher we will use two types of actors:

    * __Primary__: Always placed on the left hand side of the boundary. Primary actors are the people who will be interacting with the system. There is no limit to how many primary actors you can have but your system must have at least one.

    * __Secondary__: Always placed on the right hand side of the boundary. Secondary actors are support systems that the main system will use. For example:

        * Databases
        * Verification systems
        * Servers

- __Use Cases__: These are the actions that the system performs, like “Log in,” “View Orders,” or “Send Email.”

- __Relationships__: These are the lines that show how actors and use cases are connected. For advanced higher there are 5 types of relationship that you must know: 

    * __Association__: Association happen between actors and use cases. Associations are drawn as a single solid line with NO arrows on the end.

    * __Generalisation of an Actor__: Generalisation of an actor means one actor CAN inherit from another actor. This allows you to share associations and keep your diagram easier to understand and follow.

    * __Extend__: Extends are shown with a dashed line with an arrow pointing towards the original use case with extend written above the line. Extend allows for extra functionality for your use cases. For example:

        * A user can pay for a purchase however a bank would need to approve the transaction.

    * __Include__: Include adds a mandatory process to your original use case. For example:

        * When a user attempts to log into a system the username and password must be checked before providing authorisation.

    * __Generalisation of a Use Case__: This allows your system to inherit two similar use case. For example: a user will have the same log in use case as an admin however the user and admin login are both seperate.

## Example Question

__Scenario__:

At Johns Town Academy, the library system is used by both students and librarians. To begin, both must log in to the system. Students can search for books and request to borrow them. Librarians can add new books to the system and approve borrowing requests from students.

## Summary

- UML Use Case Diagrams help you plan a system from the user's point of view.
- Actors are the users or systems.
- Use Cases are the actions the system allows.
- Relationships show which actor is linked to which use case.
- Use Case Diagrams are used in the analysis phase of software development.
