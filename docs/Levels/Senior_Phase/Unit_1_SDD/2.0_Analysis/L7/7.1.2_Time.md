# Time Feasibility

!!! info "‚è±Ô∏è What is Time Feasibility?"

    __Time feasibility asks__:  
    :   Can the system be developed and implemented within the available time, and will it be ready when it is needed?

    __It considers__:

    :   The time needed for development, installation, and training

        The effect on the client‚Äôs schedule or operations

    __Example__

    :   A school wants to install a new report-writing system in time for the October break. If development, testing, and training will take 4 months and it‚Äôs already July, the project may __not be time feasible__.

If the project can be completed __within a realistic timeframe__ and without disrupting important business operations, it is considered __time feasible__.

## Factors That Affect Time Feasibility

- Total time required for system development  
- Client‚Äôs calendar ‚Äî busy periods, deadlines, seasonal events  
- When installation and training can take place  
- When the system must be fully operational  
- Availability of staff and resources  

## Questions to Ask

- How long will the system take to develop?
- When is the least disruptive time to install it?
- Will it be ready by the required date?


üö® Note: A system can be __technically__ and __economically__ feasible but __still not time feasible__ if it won‚Äôt be finished in time to be useful. Delays can make the system pointless or even harmful to the organisation.

!!! info "Key Points"
	    
    * Time feasibility focuses on __scheduling and deadlines__
		
    *  A system must be ready __when the client needs it__.

    *  Development, training, and installation must fit within the timeline.

    *  Failing to meet the deadline can make the system __unusable__, even if it works perfectly
