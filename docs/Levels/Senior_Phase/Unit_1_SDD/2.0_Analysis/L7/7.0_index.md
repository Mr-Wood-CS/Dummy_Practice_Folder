# Analysis

In this section, we will explore the first phase of the software development process: __Analysis__. This phase is crucial as it lays the groundwork for a successful system by clearly understanding what the problem is and what the system must do to solve it.

You will develop your skills, knowledge, and understanding in line with the __SQA Advanced Higher Computing Science__ course assessment by studying the following key areas:

Identifying the __purpose and functional requirements__ of a problem, including:

:   * Inputs
    * Processes
    * Outputs

Conducting __feasibility studies__, with a focus on:

:   * Economic feasibility
    * Time feasibility
    * Legal feasibility
    * Technical feasibility
    * User surveys

__Planning techniques__ and __documentation__, including:

:   * Scheduling
    * Resource planning
    * Gantt charts

Producing detailed __requirement specifications__:

:   * End-user requirements
    * System scope, boundaries, and constraints
    * Functional requirements

Creating and interpreting __Unified Modelling Language (UML)__ diagrams, specifically:

: * Use case diagrams
    * Actors, use cases, and relationships

ðŸš« Please note: we have already studied how to:

:   * Identify functional requirements in terms of __inputs, processes, and outputs__
    * Produce __requirement specifications__ including end-user requirements, scope, and constraints

These topics will __not be revisited in detail__ here. If you need a refresher, please go to either __National4/5 Computing Science__ or __Higher Computing Science__ in the navigation bar above.
