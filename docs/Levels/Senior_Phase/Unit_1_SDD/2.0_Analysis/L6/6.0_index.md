# Analysis

!!! tip "Quick Links"

    * [Purpose](#purpose)
    * [Scope](#scope)
    * [Boundaries](#boundaries)

!!! info "What you need to know"

    You must be able to identify the:

    * purpose

    * scope

    * boundaries

    * functional requirements
    
    of a problem that relates to the design and implementation at this level, in terms of:

    * inputs

    * processes
    
    * outputs

## Purpose

The __Purpose__ is a really important part of the analysis stage. It’s all about clearly stating what the software is meant to do – basically, what problem it’s solving or what task it needs to complete. 

A clear purpose helps everyone involved understand what the end goal is, and it makes sure the rest of the project stays on track. 

In addition, it also helps when you’re thinking about what the program will need to take in (__inputs__), what it will do (__processes__), and what it should produce (__outputs__). 

If the purpose isn’t clear, it’s easy for the software to end up doing the wrong thing or not meeting the user’s needs. A good purpose is simple, focused, and makes it easy to check if the final product works the way it’s supposed to.

The SQA define purpose as a __general description__ of the software. 

This is often summarised using the **IPO model**:

- **Inputs** – What information the program receives  
- **Processes** – What the program does with that information  
- **Outputs** – What the program produces or displays  

This model helps developers stay focused on what the software is meant to do, and it links closely to the functional requirements.

## Scope

The __Scope__ is where you set the boundaries of what the software will and won’t do. 

Once the purpose is clear, the scope builds on that by outlining exactly what features or tasks will be included in the project – and just as importantly, what’s being left out. 

This helps keep the project realistic and manageable, especially if there are time or resource limits. It also stops feature creep, where new ideas get added in along the way and make everything more complicated. 

A clear scope gives everyone – from developers to users – a shared understanding of what to expect, which makes planning and development much smoother.

## Boundaries

The __Boundaries__ identify what’s outside the system – in other words, the parts the software won’t deal with. While the scope tells us what’s included in the system, boundaries help make it clear where the system ends and where other systems or people take over. 

For example, if a program needs information from a database but doesn’t manage the database itself, that database would be outside the boundary. 

Setting boundaries is useful because it helps avoid confusion about what the software is responsible for. It also makes it easier to plan and design the system by focusing only on what actually needs to be built.

## Functional Requirements

The __Functional Requirements__ describe what the software must do – the specific features and functions it must include to solve the problem.

They are usually based on the purpose, and they describe how the software will handle:

- **Inputs** – what data the user or other systems will enter into the software  
- **Processes** – what the software will do with the data  
- **Outputs** – what the software should produce or display

These requirements are often written as a list of tasks or actions the software should be able to perform. They help programmers understand exactly what they need to build, and they’re used later for testing to make sure everything works correctly.

**Example:**  
> A lunch ordering system might have the following functional requirements:  
> - The user can select items from a menu (input)  
> - The system calculates the total cost (process)  
> - The system displays the final order and price (output)

## Worked Example: School Club Registration System

A school wants a simple system for pupils to sign up for after-school clubs.

### Purpose
To allow pupils to register for clubs online and allow teachers to view a list of attendees.

### Scope
- Pupils can view a list of clubs.
- Pupils can choose a club and enter their name to register.
- Teachers can access a list of attendees.

### Boundaries
- The system will not include login or password protection.
- It won’t manage room bookings or send notifications.
- It won’t store data beyond a single session (unless stated).

### Functional Requirements
- Display list of clubs (output)
- Accept pupil name and club selection (input)
- Store registration in memory (process)
- Display confirmation message (output)
