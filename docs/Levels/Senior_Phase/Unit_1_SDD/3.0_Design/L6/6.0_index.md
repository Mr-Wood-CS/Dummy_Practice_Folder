# Design

!!! info "What You Need to Know"

    __You must be able to__:

    - Identify appropriate __data types and structures__ required to solve a problem.
    - Read, interpret, and implement __design solutions__ using the following recognised design techniques:
        - **Structure diagrams** (including top-level design, refinements, and data flow)
        - **Pseudocode**
    - Use a recognised technique to design an __efficient solution__ to a problem.
    - Describe and design **user interfaces** using wireframes to show input, output, and layout clearly.

Effective problem-solving at Higher level begins with careful planning and selecting the right design techniques to produce efficient, modular, and maintainable code.

## Modular Design

At Higher level, you use a modular approach to break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

:   __Top Down Design__

    * Start with the complete problem
    * Break it into high-level tasks
    * Each task becomes a module
    * These modules are refined further using __stepwise refinement__

    Top-down design helps you plan a solution before coding begins.

    __Top Level Design__

    The top level shows the main steps of your program.

    * It identifies the main components that will be refined into smaller tasks.

    __Stepwise Refinement__

    This is the process of breaking each module into smaller sub-tasks.

    * Keep breaking each task down until it’s simple enough to implement
    * Each refinement should do just one job
    * This is reflected by designing each module in increasing detail, until it’s ready to be implemented.

    __Refinements__

    Refinements are the smaller sub-tasks created by applying stepwise refinement.

    * Each one is a sub-task that contributes to solving the overall problem
    * You continue refining until each task is simple enough to implement directly in code.

    __Data Flow__

    Data flow shows how information moves between modules.

    * This can be represented visually by showing which data is passed between modules
    * Inputs and outputs must be labelled
    * This helps you understand how modules work together

Once a modular design has been created, a recognised design technique can be used to represent and refine it.

## Recognised Design Techniques

To plan and understand solutions, the following techniques are used:

- **Structure diagrams** show the hierarchical breakdown of a program into modules. They help visualise top-level design, refinement, and the flow of data between components.

- **Pseudocode** expresses a solution using structured, language-agnostic steps. It allows you to refine algorithms in plain, logical terms before coding.

In addition, **user interface design** (via wireframes) outlines how input and output are managed. Wireframes use annotated sketches or mockups to show how users interact with a system.
