# UML (Unified Modelling Language)

## What Is UML?

Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a graphical standardised design language used to model a system. The system may be software or non-software. 

UML provides a clear visual representation of the system making that system easier to understand and maintain. 

Using UML, you can model just about any type of application, running on any type and combination of hardware, operating system, programming language, and network. 

Built upon fundamental object-oriented concepts including class and operation, UML is particularly useful in object-oriented software development where it is used to create visual models of software systems.

There are many different applications of UML diagrams but we will only be looking at two, they are:

> Use case diagram shows the functionality of the system from the usersâ€™ perspective and is essentially non-technical. 

> Class diagrams show a class represented by a rectangle labelled by its name, attributes and operations. Classes may be associated similar to entity relationships.  (These will be covered in the Object Oriented Programming Pages)
