Flowcharts are a type of design notation used to show the sequence of steps in a program. They are read from top to bottom, following the arrows that show the flow of control.

Flowcharts can be used to represent any kind of program but are especially useful for clearly showing decisions (using selection) and loops (using repetition).

## Loops in Flowcharts

Flowcharts don’t have a specific symbol for loops. Instead, a loop is shown using a decision symbol with one arrow looping back to a previous step.

For example, in the diagram below, if the password is incorrect, the program shows an error message and then loops back to ask for the password again. This loop continues until the user enters the correct password.


Flowcharts don’t have a specific symbol for loops. Instead, they have to show a loop as a decision, with the arrows going up/backwards.

In this example, if the password is not correct, the program shows an error message, and then the arrow points back towards asking for the password again. 

This loop will continue until the user enters a correct password, breaking the loop.

!!! info "Do I Need to Draw Flowcharts?"

    Some people prefer flowcharts over other design methods, while others do not. According to the course specification:

    > You will not be expected to draw a flowchart from scratch.

    > You will usually be given a choice of design notations, such as a flowchart or a structure diagram.

    However, you must be able to:

    * read and understand flowcharts
    * answer questions based on flowcharts you are given
