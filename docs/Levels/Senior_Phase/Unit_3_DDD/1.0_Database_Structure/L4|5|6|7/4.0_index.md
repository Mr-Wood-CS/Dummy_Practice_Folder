# Database Structure

## What is a Database?

A database is an organized collection of information or data. Putting information into a computer database gives you far more flexibility in organising, displaying and printing that information.
Almost everyone who uses a computer will use a database system for something:

* Banks use a database package for storing customers' accounts information
* Your school will use a database package to store information on all the pupils in the school
* Police use databases to keep information on people with criminal records

## Flat File Databases

A flat file database is a database that stores all data in a single table:

* Only one table is used.
* All data is stored in rows and columns within that one table.

## Structure of a Flat File Database

__Fields__

A 'Field' holds one piece of data at a time ‚Äì for example, a person's name, age, or phone number.

__Records__

A 'Record' holds all the data for one entry in the table ‚Äì for example, all the information about a single customer.

## Relational Databases

A relational database consists of two or more tables that are linked through relationships (__Primary and Foreign keys__) and the data they store.

__Primary Keys__

A __primary key__ is a field that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
No two records can have the same value in the __primary key field__, and it cannot be left blank.

‚úÖ Example: In the __Membership table__, the __User ID__ could be the __primary key__ because each user must have a __unique ID__.

__Foreign Keys__

A foreign key is a field in one table that links to the __primary key__ in another table.

This relationship connects the data between tables and helps maintain consistency in the database.

‚úÖ Example: Our database has a __Membership table__ and a __Gym Details table__.

* In the __Gym Details__ table, the __Gym ID__ is the __primary key__.

* In the __Membership table__, each member record includes a __Gym ID__ as a __foreign key__ to show which gym the member belongs to.

üö® __Note__

In database design, each `Table` in a relational database represents an __Entity__ ‚Äî a real-world object like a Customer or Product.

Each `Field` (or column) in the table represents an __Attribute__ ‚Äî a property of that entity, such as Name or Price.

This difference is important when designing the structure of your database, even though software like Access may still use the terms __*table*__ and __*field*__.

‚ö†Ô∏è __Don‚Äôt confuse a record with an entity__. In a flat file database, each record is one instance of an entity (e.g. one customer). In relational databases, the table represents the entity.

    * Avoids data duplication.
    * Complex queries can be carried out on multiple tables.
    * Easier to maintain security.
    * Easier to change/update data.
