# Analysis

!!! info "What you need to know"

    You must be able to identify the end-user and functional requirements of a database problem that relates to the implementation at this level.

When designing a database, it's important to understand what the people using the system need it to do. This means identifying:

- **End-user requirements** – what the users want to be able to do with the database
- **Functional requirements** – what the database must include and be able to do

We will use a __School Library__ example to help explain these ideas.

## End-user Requiremnts and Functional Requirements

Before creating a database, we must find out what the people who will use it want it to do. These are called the __end-user requirements__:

* the users are the people who are going to be using the database 
* their requirements are the tasks they expect to be able to do using the database 

We also need to know what the database itself must include and be able to do to meet those needs — these are the __functional requirements__:

* processes and activities that the system has to perform  
* information that the system has to contain to be able to carry out its functions 

During the analysis stage of Database Development, you will need to identify the following requirements:

These requirements help:  

* clarify the design of the database 
* identify the features to be implemented on the database  
* evaluate whether the system is fit for purpose after development is complete


__Example__

A secondary school wants to create a database to keep track of its library books, the pupils who borrow them, and the borrowing history.

The database will help school staff manage books and allow pupils to search for and borrow books.

The database will have the following tables:

1. __Book__ – to store details of books in the library  
2. __Pupil__ – to store details of pupils who borrow books  
3. __Loan__ – to store details of which books have been borrowed and returned

__End-User Requirements__

Remember, these are the things the users of the database need it to do. In this case, the users are the library staff and pupils.

They database should be able to:

- Search for books by title, author, or genre
- See if a book is available or already on loan
- View a list of books a pupil has borrowed
- Check which books are overdue
- Sort books by title or date added

!!! tip "Top Tip"
    Think about what the users need the database to do — what tasks will help them?

__Functional Requirements__

Remember, these describe what the database must contain and what it must do to meet the needs of the users.

The database will include three tables: Book, Pupil, and Loan.

Each table needs a __primary key__ – a unique ID to identify each record. The Loan table will also need __foreign keys_ to link to the Book and Pupil tables.

In addition to a primary key and any necessary foreign keys, the following fields are required:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :octicons-database-16:{ .lg .middle } __Book__

    ---

    * Book ID (primary key)  
    * Title  
    * Author  
    * Genre  
    * Year Published  
    * Available (Yes/No)

-   :octicons-database-16:{ .lg .middle } __Pupil__

    ---

    * Pupil ID (primary key)  
    * First Name  
    * Surname  
    * Class

-   :octicons-database-16:{ .lg .middle } __Loan__

    ---

    * Loan ID (primary key)  
    * Book ID (foreign key)  
    * Pupil ID (foreign key)  
    * Date Borrowed  
    * Date Returned  

-   :octicons-database-16:{ .lg .middle } __The database must also be able to:__

    ---

    * Search for books based on different fields (title, author, genre)
    * Sort results alphabetically or by date
    * Check if a book is available
    * List all books borrowed by a pupil
    * Identify overdue books

By clearly identifying the end-user and functional requirements, you can make sure your database is designed with the right users and tasks in mind. This helps avoid problems later in development and ensures the final system does exactly what it needs to. Good analysis at this stage sets the foundation for a successful project.
