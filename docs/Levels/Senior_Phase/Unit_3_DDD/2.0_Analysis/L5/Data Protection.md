Functional Requirements
The relational database will have four tables: Hotel, Resort, Booking and Customer.
 
Each table requires a suitable primary key field, with foreign keys linking the four tables.
 
In addition to a primary key and any necessary foreign keys, the following fields are required:
 
Hotel

Use the following:
●	simple and complex queries to search the database
