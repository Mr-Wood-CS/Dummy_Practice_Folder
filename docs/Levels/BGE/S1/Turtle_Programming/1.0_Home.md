# Turtle Programming

This term, you will start developing your knowledge of Python code to learn how to draw graphics on to the computer screen. 

To do this, you will be using the Turtle module ‚Äì which is simply an extra part of Python. 

A module is a library of code written by a very intelligent person. 

**What does the Turtle Looks Like**

When you run your first program with the Turtle, you will see a little symbol appear on the screen that will draw your graphics. 

> Even though it doesn‚Äôt look like one, this is the **Turtle**.

**What can the Turtle do?**

The Turtle is a great way to learn how to code using Python. 

By using graphics, it‚Äôs a bit more interesting that the usual boring text you see on the screen when coding. 

The Turtle is capable of drawing almost anything you dream up ‚Äì you just need to know how to code it!

        ??? note "01 - Importing the Turtle"

            === "C"

                ``` c
                #include <stdio.h>

                int main(void) {
                  printf("Hello world!\n");
                  return 0;
                }
                ```

            === "Explanantion"

                This line reads ‚Äú**from the turtle module, import all of the functions inside of it.**‚Äù 

                This means you will have access to all the code to allow you to draw graphics on the screen.

            We need to import the functions (snippets of code) inside of the library so that we can use these extra features in our code. 

            To import all of the functions in the Turtle module, we need to add the following line of code to the start of every program we write this term:

            ``` python
            from turtle import *
            ```

        This line reads ‚Äú**from the turtle module, import all of the functions inside of it.**‚Äù 

        This means you will have access to all the code to allow you to draw graphics on the screen.

        **Moving the Turtle**

        You need to think of the Turtle as a pen ‚Äì as it moves across your screen (which is your canvas), it will draw a line. We can move the Turtle forward and back. 

        The bigger the number, the further your turtle will go. Obviously, the smaller the number, the smaller the line that the Turtle will draw. **Try it out!**

        <figure markdown="span">
          ![](Images/Turtle_2.png){ width="800" }
        </figure>

        **Changing Direction**

        By default, your Turtle will always start facing to the right. 

        It is, however, easy to change the direction in which the Turtle will draw a line. 

        To do this, you will need to tell the Turtle which direction to turn (left or right) and at how many degrees. 

        Below is an example of how many degrees you would need to turn the Turtle to head off towards the bottom right of the page. 

        You could either turn left or right ‚Äì it‚Äôs just the number of degrees that you turn that will change.

        <figure markdown="span">
          ![](Images/Turtle_3.png){ width="400" }
        </figure>

        **Examples**

        Let‚Äôs move your Turtle to create a right angle (90-degrees):

        <figure markdown="span">
          ![](Images/Turtle_4.png){ width="600" }
        </figure>

        If we were to run the same code, but turn to the left, it would look like this:

        <figure markdown="span">
          ![](Images/Turtle_5.png){ width="600" }
        </figure>

        By continuing to turn at 90-degrees, you are able to make your first shape:

        <figure markdown="span">
          ![](Images/Turtle_6.png){ width="600" }
        </figure>

        **Changing Colour & Size**

        You are able to add a splash of colour to your lines by using the color function. 

        A list of all the different colours you can use can be seen below:

        <figure markdown="span">
          ![](Images/Turtle_9.png){ width="900" }
        </figure>

        **Changing the Colour of the Pen**

        You can change the color of your pen by using the `color` function. 

        <figure markdown="span">
          ![](Images/Turtle_7.png){ width="300" }
        </figure>

        **Changing the Line Thickness**

        You can change the thickness of your line by using the `pensize` function. 

        The higher the number, the thicker the line becomes:

## Lesson Two

    ??? info "Understanding Co-ordinates"

        **Understanding Co-ordinates**

        The screen in Python has been setup with an x-axis and a y-axis. The default Turtle window size is approximately 750 x 640 steps. 

        It looks like this:

        <figure markdown="span">
          ![](Images/Turtle_15.png){ width="800" }
        </figure>

        When you run your code, Python automatically positions your Turtle at the coordinates (0, 0) ‚Äì which is the centre of the screen. 

        You can, however, move the Turtle to any position you like on the screen. 

        You will need to lift your Turtle up off the page, go to the desired coordinates and then put your Turtle back down on the page ready for drawing.

        **Draw a second square anywhere in the bottom right quadrant of the page with an orange outline.**
        
        **Both squares must have equal sides of 100 steps and a pen size of 10.**

## Lesson Three 

??? info "Lesson Notes"


    ??? info "Drawing Shapes with Loops"

        **Sequencing to Iteration**

        We should now know that drawing shapes with Turtle is quite straightforward. 
        
        However, it becomes even easier‚Äîand much faster‚Äîwhen you use a loop. 
        
        When creating shapes like squares, rectangles, or triangles, you might have noticed that the same lines of code are repeated over and over. 
        
        Instead of writing the same instructions multiple times, we can use a loop to reduce repetition and make our code cleaner.

        !!! example "Creating a Square"

            Instead of writing the first chunk of code to draw a square like below:
            
            ``` python title="Without a Loop" linenums="1"

            from turtle import *

            forward(100)
            left(90)
            forward(100)
            left(90)
            forward(100)
            left(90)
            forward(100)
            left(90)

            ``` 
            It could be easily written with a for loop:

            ``` python title="With a Loop" linenums="1"
            from turtle import *

            for i in range(4):
              forward(100)
              right(90)
            ```

        **Sequencing to Iteration**

        We should now know that drawing shapes with Turtle is quite straightforward. 
        
        However, it becomes even easier‚Äîand much faster‚Äîwhen you use a loop. 
        
        When creating shapes like squares, rectangles, or triangles, you might have noticed that the same lines of code are repeated over and over. 
        
        Instead of writing the same instructions multiple times, we can use a loop to reduce repetition and make our code cleaner.

        !!! example "Creating a Square"

            Instead of writing the first chunk of code to draw a square like below:
            
            ``` python title="Without a Loop" linenums="1"

            from turtle import *

            forward(100)
            left(90)
            forward(100)
            left(90)
            forward(100)
            left(90)
            forward(100)
            left(90)

            ``` 
            It could be easily written with a for loop:

            ``` python title="With a Loop" linenums="1"
            from turtle import *

            for i in range(4):
              forward(100)
              right(90)
            ```

    ??? info "Drawing Patterns with Loops"

        By using the same method that you used to draw basic shapes (like squares and triangles), you can create some pretty cool patterns. Check out the examples below:

        ### 1 - Pentagon

        **Write the code to draw a pentagon with 100 step sides.**
        
        **It must have an outline of `size 5` and colour of `hotpink`.** 
        
        **Your code needs to be as efficient as possible, meaning that your shape must be drawn with a for loop.**
        
        > Remember, pentagons have 5 sides, so to work out the angle you need at each corner, divide 360 by 5.
