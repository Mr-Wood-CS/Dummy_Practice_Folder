# Python Programming

Welcome to Python programming! In this unit, you’ll learn how to talk to a computer by writing your own code using Python – a simple but powerful programming language. You’ll create interactive programs, make decisions using if statements, and get a taste of how real software is built. Don’t worry if this is your first time coding – we’ll take it step by step, and there’ll be plenty of chances to try things out and get creative. By the end of the unit, you’ll have the skills to build your own basic programs and understand how computers follow instructions.
