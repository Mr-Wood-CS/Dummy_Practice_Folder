# Introduction to Python Programming

??? "Lesson One - Displaying Data

    ==The Print Statement==

    Today weâ€™ll learn about the print command, which lets us make the computer show messages or answers on the screen:
    ``` python linenums="1"
    print ("Hello World!")
    ```
    !!! info

        * print() is written in lowercase only
        * print() displays whatever is between the ()
        * print() forms part of a sequence

    ==Mathematical Operations==

    Today we will be using the print command to also perform calculations

    There are four operators that we need to know:
    
    <table class = "testing">
        <tr>
            <th>Operator</th>
            <th>Used For</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>+</td>
            <td>Addition</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>Subtraction</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>*</td>
            <td>Multiplication</td>
            <td>Should be accepted</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>180</td>
            <td>Exceptional</td>
            <td>Should be rejected</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
