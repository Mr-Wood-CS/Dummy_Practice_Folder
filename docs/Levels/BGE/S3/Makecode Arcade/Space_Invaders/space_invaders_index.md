# Space Invaders

Welcome to the Space Invaders unit â€“ an exciting journey into the world of game development using MakeCode Arcade!

Over the course of this unit, youâ€™ll learn how to build your very own version of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. Youâ€™ll take on the role of a game developer, learning the key skills needed to bring your ideas to life on screen â€“ from designing characters and backgrounds to coding player movement, shooting mechanics, and enemy behaviours.

ðŸ’¡ Why this matters:

Game development is a fun and creative way to learn computational thinking, problem solving, and real programming logic. Youâ€™ll build confidence in your ability to plan, code, and test digital systems â€“ key skills in Computing Science and beyond.

By the end of this unit, youâ€™ll have a working Space Invaders game â€“ and the knowledge to customise and improve it even further.
