    # Feasability Studies

    !!! info "What you Need to Know"

        Describe, exemplify, and implement research for:
    
        * feasibility studies:
            * economic
            * time
            * legal
            * technical
        * user surveys

    Before starting a new system, it’s important to decide if it’s worth the time and money. This is where a __feasibility study__ comes in as it helps determine:

    * Is the project realistic?
    * Can it be achieved within time and budget?
    * Will it meet the goals set in the __problem definition__?

    A feasibility study should:

    * Be low-cost and quick to complete

    * Involve __no legal commitment__ to proceed

    * Suggest __options or alternatives__

    * End with a clear report for the client, showing:
        * Costs
        * Benefits
        * Possible solutions
        * Recommendations

    !!! info "Key Points"
        
        * The feasibility study should be conducted relatively cheaply and within a fairly short time frame. 
        
        * There are no legal or contractual requirements at this stage.
        
        * The findings of the feasibility study are presented to the client in the form of a report.
        
        * This report indicates costs, benefits, alternatives and appropriate recommendations.
